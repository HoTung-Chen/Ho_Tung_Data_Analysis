# Ho_Tung_Data_Analysis

## [Project 1: House_Prediction_Prices]()
* **Data cleaning techniques are applied,**
1. **Handling missing values, outlier detection using boxplot and drop off the unrelated features**  
2. **Data-types change to suite the machine learning algorithum**
3. **EDA such as seaborn and maplotlib (Eg.heatmap correlation)**
* **Machine Learning Models such as linear regression, KNN, Decision Trees, SVM and Random Forest**
* **Summary to shown best models to apply**
* **Save and load the new data set for predictions**
* **Save with sklearn_version**
